    The blocks below are sorted by max evolutions AND number of candies.
    Color coding is as follows: green background represents single stage evolves that can just be done.
    The blue background represents situations where a double evolution can be completed.  
    The pink means that the pokemon "family" has multiple evolutions, but that there is not yet
    enough candy to do a double evolve.
    The yellow/tan blocks represent upcoming single evolves that are getting close to being ready.
